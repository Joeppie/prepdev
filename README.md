# prepdev
A set of bash scripts that prepare a linux (developed on mint 18.2) machine for developing against ceres, opencv and openMVG

This repo may be expanded to include sample projects that make use of the above libraries to provide a running start with developing new applications.

## Running the scripts
Download the repo and execute the scripts. Run them as the user that you wish to develop as, sudo will be asked for when necessary.
depending on the machine, installation and compilation of libraries may take some time. 

On a fast machine, this can typically be done in about 15-20 mintes
